Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software Engineering is the systematically application engineering principle,methods, and tools to development and maintenance of high quality software.
it plays a crucial role in technology industry by enabling the creation of software application and system that powers various aspect of mordern life.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
the development of programming language,the establishment of software Engineering as a disciple in 1960sand the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirements 
Design 
implementation 
testing
Deployment
maintenance 
Requirement:Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design:Creating high level and detailed designs of the soft ware architecture user interface.
implementation:Writing codes and building the software according to design specifications.
Testing:Conducting various test to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.  
Deployment: Releasing the software to user or customer.
Maintanance:providing ongoing support,updates and enhancement to software after deployment.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile promotes ongoing collaboration.while waterfall focus on through planning and execursion in predetermine states.
example of agile is extreme programming 
example of waterfall methodologies: the construction of buildings. 
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is responsible for writing codes and implementations software solutions.
Quality insurance Engineer:Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plan.
Project manager:someone who oversees planning execution, and delivery of software project.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs:Are software suits that provides a comprehensive tools for writing debugging and testing codes.e.g Visual studios.
VCS:software tools for tracking changes and coordinating work among team members.e.g Git.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
the rapid growing of technology as it grows in phenomenal rate which leads to pressure for software Engineers.
Growing customer demands
limit infrastructure.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing: Testing individual components or modules or software.e.g when a function adds 2 integers and return sum as output.
integrating testing:Testing interaction between different components or subsystem.e.g when 2 systems are tested in combine way.
system testing:testing the entire software system as a whole.e.g entering incorrect login credentials.
Acceptance Testing:testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.e.g Alpha and beta testing.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt Engineering is all about crafting questions or statements so as to get the best response from an AI
its importance include geting a clear and specific answer. it also helps in getting a concise answers and saves a lot of time.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
who is the current president.
who is the current president of Nigeria.
by adding a specific country it narrows down the search.
